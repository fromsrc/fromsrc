install dependencies:

```bash
bun add fromsrc
```

wire adapter in your react docs shell:

```tsx
import { AdapterProvider, astroAdapter } from "fromsrc/astro";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

export function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
	return <AdapterProvider adapter={astroAdapter}>{children}</AdapterProvider>;
}
```

render this component in an astro island with `client:load` and keep markdown content in a shared `docs/` directory.
