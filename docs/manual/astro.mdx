install dependencies:

```bash
bun add fromsrc marked
bun add -D astro
```

use a docs route that reads mdx as raw text and renders html:

```astro
---
import { marked } from "marked"
import doc from "../../content/docs/index.mdx?raw"
const html = String(marked.parse(doc))
---

<article set:html={html} />
```

for the default scaffold shape, redirect `/` to `/docs` in `src/pages/index.astro` and render the docs shell in `src/pages/docs.astro`.

if you need adapter-level control for component wiring, use the astro adapter:

```tsx
import { AdapterProvider, astroAdapter } from "fromsrc/astro"
import type { ReactNode } from "react"

export function Providers({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
	return <AdapterProvider adapter={astroAdapter}>{children}</AdapterProvider>
}
```

keep markdown content in `content/docs/` so navigation and ai endpoints stay aligned across frameworks.
