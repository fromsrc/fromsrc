## vs fumadocs

fumadocs is a great framework with powerful features. fromsrc takes a different approach:

<Compare>
  <Column title="fumadocs">
    - content layer abstraction
    - opinionated structure
    - many built-in integrations
    - larger bundle size
  </Column>
  <Column title="fromsrc">
    - direct mdx access
    - flexible structure
    - bring your own integrations
    - minimal core
  </Column>
</Compare>

## vs docusaurus

docusaurus is a mature framework from meta. here's how we compare:

<Compare>
  <Column title="docusaurus">
    - swizzle system for customization
    - react 18 support
    - slower builds at scale (3k+ files)
    - large plugin ecosystem
  </Column>
  <Column title="fromsrc">
    - direct component access
    - react 19 support
    - optimized for large sites
    - composable primitives
  </Column>
</Compare>

## vs mintlify

mintlify offers a hosted solution. fromsrc is self-hosted:

<Compare>
  <Column title="mintlify">
    - $300+/month hosted

    - managed infrastructure
    - closed source
  </Column>
  <Column title="fromsrc">
    - free and open source
    - full customization
    - deploy anywhere
    - own your code
  </Column>
</Compare>

## vs nextra

nextra is a simple docs solution built on next.js:

<Compare>
  <Column title="nextra">
    - single maintainer
    - simple configuration
    - limited component library
    - tightly coupled to next.js
  </Column>
  <Column title="fromsrc">
    - active development
    - flexible configuration
    - extensive components
    - multi-framework support (planned)
  </Column>
</Compare>

## when to choose fromsrc

fromsrc is ideal when you need:

- full control over your documentation ui
- optimized builds for large documentation sites
- ai-native features (llms.txt, raw content)
- a foundation you own and can customize
- modern react patterns and server components

## when to choose alternatives

consider other options if you need:

- a hosted solution with no maintenance (mintlify)
- maximum plugin ecosystem (docusaurus)
- simplest possible setup (nextra)
