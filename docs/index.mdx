fromsrc is a documentation framework built for performance and full control.

## why fromsrc

we built fromsrc around four principles:

- **composable** - small pieces that combine freely
- **editable** - change anything without fighting the framework
- **customizable** - swap any component, style, or behavior
- **optimized** - incremental builds, scales to thousands of files

## quick start

```bash
bunx create-fromsrc
cd my-docs
bun dev
```

## features

- **mdx** - write docs with react components embedded
- **search** - fast client-side search with ⌘K
- **dark mode** - built-in theme support
- **responsive** - mobile-friendly layout
- **llms.txt** - ai-ready content export
- **composable** - every component is customizable
