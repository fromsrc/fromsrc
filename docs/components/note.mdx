lightweight inline notes for quick annotations.

## note

  this feature requires version 2.0 or later
</Note>
```

<Note>
  this feature requires version 2.0 or later
</Note>

## important

highlight important information:

```mdx
<Important>
  make sure to backup your data before proceeding
</Important>
```

<Important>
  make sure to backup your data before proceeding
</Important>

## experimental

mark experimental features:

```mdx
<Experimental>

```

<Experimental>

</Experimental>

## vs callout

use `Note` for brief inline annotations. use `Callout` for longer, more prominent messages that need icons and titles.
